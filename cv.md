I'm a junior front-end developer. I've decided to become a front-end dev on my third year in the university. There were some classes about web-dev basics. After few doubles I understood, that it's the thing I really like. My goal is to learn as much as possible to be proud of things I do. It's not about prestige or something like that, front-end is something inspiring, kind of art, where you can create beautiful and useful applications and every time tou will learn a lot of new information. So, my goal is to do my best.

  * Libraries: _React, CSS frameworks (bootstrap, foundation, skeleton)_
